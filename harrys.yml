      response_text: 'The main difference between the Truman and the Winston are in
        their material and weight. Just to clear up any confusion: they both use the
        same blade and provide the same great shave.The Truman handle is designed
        with a rubberized matte material, texturized grip pattern and weighted core
        for maximum grip and control. The Winston has a metal core and is coated in
        chrome with strategically placed rubberized grips for even more control while
        you shave. Both razors are designed to optimize performance and control for
        their given weight. As for the actual weight, the Truman''s weight (without
        a cartridge) is 1.39 ounces and the Winston''s weight (without a cartridge)
        is 1.32Â ounces.'

        incredibly durable. Our German partners attest that they will perform well
        for long, long periods of time. Of course, because Harryâ\x80\x99s blades
        also happen to be affordable, we couldnâ\x80\x99t blame you for wanting to
        indulge in the luxury of changing them a little more frequently. Many guys
        tell us that they like to change their blades every 6-8 shaves. Whether you
        change blades every day or every month, weâ\x80\x99re here to help talk you
        through it. Feel free to call us at (888) 212.6855 or email us at help@harrys.com

        products. Check out https://closer.harrys.comFor our Winston Handle, we incorporated
        some customer feedback and added additional features to improve functionality.
        The beautiful chrome handle will now be accented withÂ a strategically placedÂ rubberized
        grip for even more control while you shave. The polished, chrome finish reinforces
        the Winston's classic, yet high quality, feel. It has the same substance and
        controlÂ as the original while incorporating new features!Don't worry, while
        the Winston handle has been upgraded, it still fits the same, high-quality
        Harry's blades that you know and love. The new handle will fit both our new
        and improved blades and the prior design, in case you still have some of those
        around.Our new blade cartridgeÂ offers even more of what you need for a close
        and comfortable shave. We've added a Precision Trimmer toÂ the top of the
        cartridgeÂ for hard to reach placesÂ likeÂ under your nose and trimming/edgingÂ yourÂ sideburnsÂ andÂ facial
        hair. Improved flexibility in the hinge allows for more comfortable glide
        against the contours of your face while the aloe lubrication strip provides
        a smooth finish.In the spirit of moving forward, our previous handle and blades
        will no longer be available, but we know you'll love these products just as
        much (or even more).

          value_before_type_cast: As of July 19, we do! Our second generation of blades
            offers even more of what you need for a close and comfortable shave. We've
            added a Precision Trimmer ("trimmer blade") Â to the top of the cartridge
            for detailed shaving for hard to reach places (under your nose) and trimming/edging
            (sideburns, shaping facial hair). Improved flexibility in the hinge allows
            for a more comfortable glide against the contours of your face while the
            aloe lubrication strip provides a smooth finish. Consumer tests showed
            a significant preference for Gen 2 blades over Gen 1. It's our best shave
            yet and you can get more information here:Â https://closer.harrys.com/

  :answer: !ruby/object:Answer
    raw_attributes:
      id: 20
      company_id: 1
      response_text: We always recommend taking a nice, long shower before shaving
        -- or at least rinsing your face well with warm water. This helps to hydrate
        your whiskers and soften them up before you get to shaving.Â Once your skin
        and hair are prepared, apply a thin layer of our moisturizing shave cream.
        The amount needed may vary depending on how much stubble you have accumulated,
        but a dollop the size of a half-inch thick Quarter would be a good place to
        start. Then, spend 15-20 seconds massaging the cream into all the nooks and
        crannies of your face and neck, pick up your favorite Harry's razor, and get
        to shaving.

  :answer: !ruby/object:Answer
    raw_attributes:
      id: 22
      company_id: 1
      response_text: The choice between Foaming Shave Gel and Shave Cream is one of
        preference. Our Foaming Shave Gel dispenses as a dense gel but quickly becomes
        a foam upon application, providing cushion and protection during your shave,
        while our Shave Cream applies more thinly but allows for an equally smooth
        glide and close shave. Both products not only protect your face during the
        shave, but continue to moisturize afterwards.

        products at the best value possible by designing, manufacturing andÂ selling
        our products directly to you. As we grow, we are able to produce some products
        more cost effectively and try to pass on some of those savings to our customers
        by decreasing prices. In fact, we've been able to decrease the prices of our
        Foaming Shave Gel and Post Shave Balm by a few dollars without changing the
        quality or formula.Sometimes we experience an increase in price of raw materials
        and labor, but still want to continue making products that meet high quality
        standards. Therefore, we may need to increase prices slightly or decrease
        the discount we offer on larger quantities. This year we decreased the discount
        on larger quantities of our blades, while making sure that each blade still
        costs $2 or less. In our 16-pack each blade is priced at $1.75 and in our
        8-pack each blade is priced at $2.00.PricingÂ is something we take very seriously,
        and whenever we change prices we always do it with the intent to deliver the
        best quality products to our customers at the best possible value.

        you to know that the $6 fee only applies to shipping and will never go above

      response_text: 'We understand this can be frustrating when you''re just trying
        to get your shave on. Some Canadian banks don''t verify via billing address
        (which is a main verification method we use), so when we request that verification
        from your bank, you see an error message -- not because the billing address
        is wrong, but because the bank simply does not provide that verification service.If
        you happen to have an Apt/Unit, try giving this a shot: when you enter your
        billing address, enter your unit number followed by a hyphen and then your
        street address in line 1. So, if you live in Apt. 35 at 5 John St, address
        line 1 would read 35-5 John St.If you don''t have an Apt/Unit or are still

            try giving this a shot: when you enter your billing address, enter your
            unit number followed by a hyphen and then your street address in line
            1. So, if you live in Apt. 35 at 5 John St, address line 1 would read
            35-5 John St.If you don''t have an Apt/Unit or are still getting an error
            after trying the above, the best thing to do is try another card. We apologize
            for the inconvenience!'
