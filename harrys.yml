- :question: What's the difference between a Truman and a Winston?
  :answer: 'The main difference between the Truman and the Winston are in their material
    and weight. Just to clear up any confusion: they both use the same blade and provide
    the same great shave.The Truman handle is designed with a rubberized matte material,
    texturized grip pattern and weighted core for maximum grip and control. The Winston
    has a metal core and is coated in chrome with strategically placed rubberized
    grips for even more control while you shave. Both razors are designed to optimize
    performance and control for their given weight. As for the actual weight, the
    Truman''s weight (without a cartridge) is 1.39 ounces and the Winston''s weight
    (without a cartridge) is 1.32Â ounces.'

    receive a tracking number from us in your inbox as soon as it ships!Â "
- :question: How do I remove the blade cartridge from my handle?
  :answer: "Hold the handle with one hand, with the Harryâ\x80\x99s logo facing you
    (blade should be facing down). With that same hand, grip the pusher (plastic connector
    piece at the top of the handle) at its base with your thumb and forefinger on
    each side of the 2 lines. Slide the pusher away from the handle. The blade should
    pop off with ease!"
- :question: How often should I change my blades?
  :answer: "Due to their fine steel and precision grinding, our blades are incredibly
    durable. Our German partners attest that they will perform well for long, long
    periods of time. Of course, because Harryâ\x80\x99s blades also happen to be affordable,
    we couldnâ\x80\x99t blame you for wanting to indulge in the luxury of changing
    them a little more frequently. Many guys tell us that they like to change their
    blades every 6-8 shaves. Whether you change blades every day or every month, weâ\x80\x99re
    here to help talk you through it. Feel free to call us at (888) 212.6855 or email
    us at help@harrys.com anytime."
- :question: Are your blades and handles compatible with other brands?
  :answer: Our blades are designed to fit with our handles exclusively, and vice versa.
    They both complement each other really well and are designed for control and precision.
- :question: Where do you ship?
  :answer: We currently ship to the entire United States, Canada, and all US Military
    locations around the world via their APO, FPO & DPO addresses. In addition, we
    ship to Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and Saipan (though, along with
    Hawaiian & Alaskan residents, you may experience slightly longer delivery times).Standard
    Economy Shipping takes between 5-10 business days.Â If for any reason you need
    to receive your order in fewer than 5 business days, you can expedite the processing
    of your order for an additional fee.Â Â Unfortunately, we are unable to expedite
    shipping to our beloved Alaska, Hawaii and US territories customers.Â Please note
    that if you have Foaming Gel in your order, 1-day and 2-day shipping options are
    not available due to the fact that aerosol canisters cannot be delivered by air.Â At
    this time, we don't ship internationally, but we hope to sometime in the near
    future.Â 
- :question: Do you offer free shipping?
  :answer: Within the United States, we offer free shipping on any order over $10.
    In Canada, we do not offer free shipping. Our standard economy option costs $6,
    but we're hoping to offer lower shipping costs to Canada in the future.
- :question: How can I get a travel blade cover?
  :answer: Travel blade covers can be purchased  for $1.It's worth mentioning that
    you'll get free shipping on any order that's over $10 in the United States. Otherwise,
    there's a $3 shipping charge. We recommend adding one to your next blade order!Â 
- :question: What's the difference between a Truman and a Winston?
  :answer: 'The main difference between the Truman and the Winston are in their material
    and weight. Just to clear up any confusion: they both use the same blade and provide
    the same great shave.The Truman handle is designed with a rubberized matte material,

    (without a cartridge) is 1.32Â ounces.'
- :question: I see there's a new Winston Handle and new blades! Tell me about them.
  :answer: There are! We're so excited to introduce our new generation of products.
    Check out https://closer.harrys.comFor our Winston Handle, we incorporated some
    customer feedback and added additional features to improve functionality. The
    beautiful chrome handle will now be accented withÂ a strategically placedÂ rubberized
    grip for even more control while you shave. The polished, chrome finish reinforces
    the Winston's classic, yet high quality, feel. It has the same substance and controlÂ as
    the original while incorporating new features!Don't worry, while the Winston handle
    has been upgraded, it still fits the same, high-quality Harry's blades that you
    know and love. The new handle will fit both our new and improved blades and the
    prior design, in case you still have some of those around.Our new blade cartridgeÂ offers
    even more of what you need for a close and comfortable shave. We've added a Precision
    Trimmer toÂ the top of the cartridgeÂ for hard to reach placesÂ likeÂ under your
    nose and trimming/edgingÂ yourÂ sideburnsÂ andÂ facial hair. Improved flexibility
    in the hinge allows for more comfortable glide against the contours of your face
    while the aloe lubrication strip provides a smooth finish.In the spirit of moving
    forward, our previous handle and blades will no longer be available, but we know
    you'll love these products just as much (or even more).
- :question: Do your blades have a trimmer blade on the back?
  :answer: As of July 19, we do! Our second generation of blades offers even more
    of what you need for a close and comfortable shave. We've added a Precision Trimmer
    ("trimmer blade") Â to the top of the cartridge for detailed shaving for hard
    to reach places (under your nose) and trimming/edging (sideburns, shaping facial
    hair). Improved flexibility in the hinge allows for a more comfortable glide against
    the contours of your face while the aloe lubrication strip provides a smooth finish.
    Consumer tests showed a significant preference for Gen 2 blades over Gen 1. It's
    our best shave yet and you can get more information here:Â https://closer.harrys.com/

- :question: Can women shave with Harry's?
  :answer: Although our razors are designed for guys with the face in mind, lots of
    women are happy Harry's customers. Now that both the Truman and Winston handles
    have added grip, they are ideal for shaving in the shower!
- :question: Where are your products made?
  :answer: We looked all over the world to find great razors for you. Deep in the
    heart of Germany, we found a company that has been making blades for over 90 years.
    We buy some of the best steel Sweden has to offer, and then we forge your blades
    in Germany in a small town near Stuttgart. Seriously.Our handles were designed
    in close partnership with a really talented industrial design firm right here
    in New York City. Then, we found an outstanding manufacturing partner near Hong
    Kong who was able to bring our vision to life. We spent a lot of time thinking
    about the ergonomics, weight, and texture of your handle.As for the Shave Cream,
    Foaming Shave Gel and Post Shave Balm,Â we teamed up with Mark & Jeff, talented
    chemists from just outside New York, to develop formulas just for Harry's. Our
    blend of natural ingredients provides comfort during the shave & soothes the skin
    after your shave.
- :question: Do your blades contain nickel?
  :answer: The steel used in our blades contains a trace amount of nickel, between
    0.10% and 0.15%.
- :question: Do I have to use both your razor and your gel or cream?
  :answer: Of course not. Our razors, Foaming Shave Gel, and Shave Cream were developed
    to work as great, standalone products, regardless of whether or not you use them
    together. That said, it never hurts to put great tires on a fast car. We'll leave
    it to you from here.
- :question: Are your blades and handles compatible with other brands?
  :answer: Our blades are designed to fit with our handles exclusively, and vice versa.
    They both complement each other really well and are designed for control and precision.
- :question: How many blades are in your cartridges?
  :answer: Each cartridge contains 5 evenly spaced, German-engineered razor blades.
- :question: What's the best way to use your Shave Cream?
  :answer: We always recommend taking a nice, long shower before shaving -- or at
    least rinsing your face well with warm water. This helps to hydrate your whiskers
    and soften them up before you get to shaving.Â Once your skin and hair are prepared,
    apply a thin layer of our moisturizing shave cream. The amount needed may vary
    depending on how much stubble you have accumulated, but a dollop the size of a
    half-inch thick Quarter would be a good place to start. Then, spend 15-20 seconds
    massaging the cream into all the nooks and crannies of your face and neck, pick
    up your favorite Harry's razor, and get to shaving.
- :question: Do you test any of your products on animals?
  :answer: We do not perform animal testing on any of our products, and that will
    never change. Some of us here in the office admittedly like to test new products
    on ourselves from time to time, but we promise we do that by choice!
- :question: What's the difference between your Foaming Shave Gel and Shave Cream?
  :answer: The choice between Foaming Shave Gel and Shave Cream is one of preference.
    Our Foaming Shave Gel dispenses as a dense gel but quickly becomes a foam upon
    application, providing cushion and protection during your shave, while our Shave
    Cream applies more thinly but allows for an equally smooth glide and close shave.
    Both products not only protect your face during the shave, but continue to moisturize
    afterwards.
- :question: Have questions about ingredients?
  :answer: We care deeply about the quality of our products. There are no parabens
    or sulfates in our formulations, and all products are both gluten-free and vegan.If
    you need a full ingredient list for any reason, please reach out to us and we'll
    send it your way.
- :question: Can I use Harry's to shave my head?
  :answer: "Our razors are designed to shave your face, not your head. Weâ\x80\x99re
    working onÂ developing products for head shaving but in the meantime, we recommend
    that youÂ only use Harryâ\x80\x99s blades for the purpose they were designed for:
    to shave your face.Â If you have any questions at all, please call or email, weâ\x80\x99d
    love to discuss them withÂ you."
- :question: The nozzle on my Foaming Shave Gel isn't working. What do I do?
  :answer: If your Foaming Shave Gel is acting stubborn, here's a trick that might
    work:Shave to your heart's content!
- :question: How do I remove the blades from the plastic blade box?
  :answer: 1.Â  Hold the blade box in one hand so that the green side is on the top
    and the clear plastic is on the bottom. Position the box so that the Mammoth is
    right-side up and Harrys.com is on the side closer to you.Â With your other hand,
    push the green protruding lip on the side face you, up and away from you. The
    box should open with relative ease.Insert the handle into the blade cartridge,
    and pull back gently to remove the blade from the box. Shave away!
- :question: Why did you change your blade box?
  :answer: "We always strive to give our customers the bestÂ experience possible.
    Our new blade box offers increased durability, keeping your blades in optimal
    condition until you are ready to use them. It's easy to use, water-friendly, and
    100% recyclable. Comes with the same Harryâ\x80\x99s blades youÂ love."
- :question: Do you ever change your product prices?
  :answer: At Harry's, we strive to offer our customers the highest quality products
    at the best value possible by designing, manufacturing andÂ selling our products
    directly to you. As we grow, we are able to produce some products more cost effectively
    and try to pass on some of those savings to our customers by decreasing prices.
    In fact, we've been able to decrease the prices of our Foaming Shave Gel and Post
    Shave Balm by a few dollars without changing the quality or formula.Sometimes
    we experience an increase in price of raw materials and labor, but still want
    to continue making products that meet high quality standards. Therefore, we may
    need to increase prices slightly or decrease the discount we offer on larger quantities.
    This year we decreased the discount on larger quantities of our blades, while
    making sure that each blade still costs $2 or less. In our 16-pack each blade
    is priced at $1.75 and in our 8-pack each blade is priced at $2.00.PricingÂ is
    something we take very seriously, and whenever we change prices we always do it
    with the intent to deliver the best quality products to our customers at the best
    possible value.
- :question: Where do you ship and how long does it take?
  :answer: 'Note for Holiday Delivery: While we work hard to ensure that everyone
    gets their order quickly, friends in Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories may experience
    shipping delays of up to a 4 weeks. We, unfortunately, cannot guarantee that you
    will receive gift orders before the Holiday season at this time. We''re so sorry
    about that! Harry''s still makes a great gift, but it might be a bit belated.
    We currently ship to the entire United States, Canada, and all US Military locations
    around the world via their APO, FPO & DPO addresses. In addition, we ship to Puerto
    Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and Saipan (though, along with Hawaiian & Alaskan
    residents, you may experience slightly longer delivery times).Standard Economy
    Shipping takes between 5-10 business days.Â If for any reason you need to receive
    your order in fewer than 5 business days, you can expedite the processing of your
    order for an additional fee.Â Â Unfortunately, we are unable to expedite shipping
    to our beloved Alaska, Hawaii and US territories customers.Â Please note that
    if you have Foaming Gel in your order, 1-day and 2-day shipping options are not
    available due to the fact that aerosol canisters cannot be delivered by air.Â At
    this time, we don''t ship internationally, but we hope to sometime in the near
    future.Â '
- :question: How do you ship?
  :answer: When you select our free shipping option, we sendÂ our packages using either
    DHL SmartMail or a service called FedEx SmartPost. Both DHL SmartMail and FedEx
    pick up your package for the first half of the journey, and then pass it off to
    the USPS -- so it goes from your local Post Office to your doorstep.Â You can
    ship anywhere the USPS ships, including physical addresses and PO Boxes.Expedited
    orders will ship via FedEx, and be delivered right to your door! Speedy shipments
    are great, but please note that expedited shipments can't be delivered to PO Boxes,
    or contain our Foaming Shave Gel.If you're ordering in Canada, all orders will
    ship via Canada Post.Â Regardless of how you're shipping, you'll receive a tracking
    number from us in your inbox as soon as it ships!Â 
- :question: How do I change or cancel my order?
  :answer: We try to fill and send your order as quickly as possible, which may limit
    our ability to add items to your order or prevent a package from shipping. If
    you're on a shave plan, you can change the timing of your shipments on yourÂ .
    For other orders, please feel free to reach out to our Customer Experience team
    and we'll do our best to get you taken care of.
- :question: What is your return policy?
  :answer: "We love the products weâ\x80\x99ve made, and we think you will too.Â If,
    after 5-8 shaves, you find that you're unhappy forÂ any reason, just let us know
    so that we can help you return your products within 30 days of receipt for a full
    refund.Â It's helpful to remember it does take some time to adjust to a new shave
    system. Experimenting with the angle and pressure should help you find the right
    approach to giving you a great shave with our razor."
- :question: Can I send a gift from Harry's to my friends?
  :answer: "The fact that youâ\x80\x99re asking this question likely means that youâ\x80\x99re
    an exceptionally caring and classy person. You can (and should) send Harryâ\x80\x99s
    as a gift to your friends and loved ones. Weâ\x80\x99ve tried to make your gift
    more special by letting you add a personalized note with your Harryâ\x80\x99s
    gift, and shipping it in a protective bag to make it as presentable as possible.
    Just be sure to add a new shipping address at checkout â\x80\x94 unless you wanted
    to gift it to yourself, that is. You'll need to placeÂ individualÂ orders if more
    than one shipping address is required.Â "
- :question: Do you offer free shipping?
  :answer: Within the United States, we offer free shipping on any order over $10.
    In Canada, we do not offer free shipping. Our standard economy option costs $6,
    but we're hoping to offer lower shipping costs to Canada in the future.Â 
- :question: Why does my order have a $6 shipping fee?
  :answer: You must be one of our Canadian friends! We contribute equally to your
    shipping costs on all orders, regardless of the transportation mode or location.
    In some cases - like sending orders via Economy in the US - this means shipping
    will be free. For orders in Canada, the costs are significantly higher, leaving
    a remainder of $6 after our contribution is applied.We want you to know that the
    $6 fee only applies to shipping and will never go above $6 regardless of order
    size (unless you select an expedited option). We're committed to making sure you
    get your Harry's on time and we're constantly looking for ways to improve the
    process so that we can deliver the best experience possible.

  :answer: Stripe is one of our payment partners. In some cases, you might see 'Stripe'
    (or a variation of Stripe) on your credit card statement for the first 24 hours.Â Within
    a day, Harry's should appear on your statement in its place. If you have any questions
    or concerns about this, just reach outÂ and we can help confirm your order!
- :question: I am purchasing from Canada. Why am I having trouble checking out?
  :answer: 'We understand this can be frustrating when you''re just trying to get
    your shave on. Some Canadian banks don''t verify via billing address (which is
    a main verification method we use), so when we request that verification from
    your bank, you see an error message -- not because the billing address is wrong,
    but because the bank simply does not provide that verification service.If you
    happen to have an Apt/Unit, try giving this a shot: when you enter your billing
    address, enter your unit number followed by a hyphen and then your street address
    in line 1. So, if you live in Apt. 35 at 5 John St, address line 1 would read
    35-5 John St.If you don''t have an Apt/Unit or are still getting an error after
    trying the above, the best thing to do is try another card. We apologize for the
    inconvenience!'
- :question: How do I use my redemption code?
  :answer: "First, thatâ\x80\x99s so cool that you have one! Youâ\x80\x99ll need to
    first need to go to harrys.com/redeem and enter your coupon code. Once you do
    so, you should see those items that the code is valid for pop up into your cart
    -- please note that the order total will be $0.00.If for any reason this process
    does not work, try adding those same items (that the coupon code is valid for)
    to your cart, proceed through checkout, and click the â\x80\x9CApply Coupon Codeâ\x80\x9D
    link on the Payment Details screen. Entering in your code will then apply the
    discount.Your coupon code is good to go for 90 days (unless otherwise noted) after
    it was first generated."
- :question: "There is a $1 charge on my bank statement - whatâ\x80\x99s that about?"
  :answer: "Awesome question! Donâ\x80\x99t worry, that $1 is merely a holding charge.
    As soon as your order is shipped out, you will be charged for exactly the total
    of your order, and that $1 will drop off immediately. It's just your bank talking
    to our bank saying 'Yup, this is a valid account.'Â "
- :question: Can I purchase Harry's products at retail locations?
