:faqs:
- :question: What are the first steps to get started with my Raden?
  :answer: See our User Guide!
- :question: How do I pair my case?
  :answer: |-
    Before pairing your case for the first time, make sure your
      battery is turned on by pulling out the “Pull to start” tab
      that sits between the battery and the Bluetooth docking station.
      Once your case is fully charged, open the Raden app and tap
      "Pair My Raden.” Your phone will confirm when your case is
      paired. If you have any issues, contact our customer experience
      team here.
- :question: How do I charge my case?
  :answer: |-
    Use your Raden mUSB to USB cable to plug your case into a
    charging outlet. To charge your case, put the mUSB plug into
    its designated port on the USB faceplate, and the USB plug into
    a computer or wall adapter. If you remove the battery from the
    case, you can charge your battery by directly plugging in
    the mUSB into the internal Powerbank and USB into a computer
    or wall adapter.
- :question: How do I get the Raden app?
  :answer: |-
    You can download the app for iOS here.
      Within the app, you can log in with your Raden account that you
      created when you purchased your case. If you haven’t created
      an account yet, you can sign up within the app.
- :question: How do I weigh my case?
  :answer: |-
    Make sure the case is resting on flat ground on all four wheels.
    On the app’s weight dashboard, click "Calibrate". The weight
    sensor will take a few seconds to calibrate. Once calibrated,
    click the “Weigh my Case” button. You may now lift the case from
    the center of the top handle. Hold still and ensure case is
    dangling freely. Your case’s weight will appear on the dashboard.
- :question: What do the LED lights represent?
  :answer: |-
    There are two LED colors with various blinking patterns. The blue light
      is associated with bluetooth, while the white light is associated with the
      battery. There are various blinking patterns for each color. The tables below
      summarizes each state:
    BLUE (bluetooth)

      Solid (not blinking): case is paired
      Blinking fast (2 second intervals): case is looking to pair.
      The case will revert to blinking slow after 30 seconds
      (see below)
      Blinking slow (4 second intervals): case is looking to
      pair, but the  process may take a few seconds longer

    WHITE (battery)

      Fast blinking: this “heartbeat” represents the battery is on low power mode (battery <20%)
      One second white light: represents that the case has been connected to a
        power source and is charging
- :question: If someone wants to borrow my case, how do they pair it with the app?
  :answer: |-
    You can either share access to your case or reset your electronics.
    To Share Access: In the Raden app, select "Your Account" and click on your case. Tap the “Share case” button. Your case will provide a password prompt before letting you (or your friend) access it.
    To Reset Electronics: Insert a long, thin instrument (a paper clip works great!) into the "Reset" hole on the Bluetooth Dock. Push the instrument until you feel the click of a button, and hold for 5-10 seconds until all five LED lights on the Powerbank flash. Once the LEDs have flashed, your case has successfully been reset.
- :question: How do I use the location features?
  :answer: On the Raden app’s home screen, click the "Location" link to enter your
    Location Dashboard. Here, you will see proximity (how far your Raden is to your
    phone), the number of cities and countries traveled to with your Raden, and historic
    map views that show your case’s last known locations. The map views are dependent
    upon the case being within Bluetooth range of a phone that has the Raden app.
- :question: How do Raden’s location features work?
  :answer: Raden’s location awareness feature leverages Crowd GPS technology. Crowd
    GPS is a no-subscription alternative to traditional GPS, consuming substantially
    less power and creating less radio-frequency interference than standard GPS modules.
    The technology uses low-powered Bluetooth signals (Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE)
    to send out a signal with a range of 100 feet / 30 meters. When a case's signal
    is picked up by any nearby user's smartphone with the Raden app, a time-stamped
    set of coordinates are sent to Raden's Crowd GPS server. This allows the case's
    owner to see a full history of their case's previously known locations in the
    Raden app. But don't worry - only the case's owner can view the case's location,
    and this is not public information that is only accessible by anyone but the owner
    of the case.
- :question: What is the Bluetooth range?
  :answer: The proximity range is approximately 100 feet / 30 meters. Digital or physical
    objects like buildings, walls, radio antennas and devices that produce radio frequency
    signals may interfere from time to time.
- :question: How long does it take to charge the battery?
  :answer: Depending on the power source, Raden’s battery will recharge from 0% to
    100% in about 5 to 10 hours.
- :question: What happens if the electronics break?
  :answer: The electronics in your case are protected through Raden’s warranty policy.
    Review our policy here or contact our customer experience team here.
- :question: Are the electronics waterproof?
  :answer: The electronics are NOT waterproof.
- :question: Do the electronics work internationally?
  :answer: |-
    Yes! Take Raden anywhere in the world - you'll be able to charge on the go,
      determine the weight of your case and track its location using the Raden app.
- :question: How many charges can I get out of the battery?
  :answer: Raden's powerful 7800mAh battery can fully charge a standard iPhone 6 four
    to five times.
- :question: How do I recharge the battery?
  :answer: |-
    Plug your case into a USB or wall outlet. You may use the cable provided
      by Raden or any mUSB to USB cord. Charge for a minimum of 60 minutes.
- :question: Can I use the battery outside the case?
  :answer: The battery works just like an external charger, so you can remove the
    battery from your Raden case and use it to charge your phone anytime, anywhere.
    To remove your battery from the case, unzip the interior lining and locate a small
    black pouch. Unzip the pouch to locate the battery. Take out the battery and use
    it like any other portable powerbank!
- :question: What happens if my airline isn't listed as an option to check the weight
    limit of my case?
  :answer: |-
    The Raden app is continuously working to include weight limitations for
      every airline. If your carrier or flight isn’t listed, please contact us
      here
      and we’ll get on the case.
- :question: Why is the Raden case so affordable?
  :answer: |-
    We believe better products lead to better experiences - and better doesn’t
      necessarily have to cost more. By avoiding middle men and third parties, Raden
      offers a high-quality case at a reasonable price without paying a million people
      along the way.
- :question: What are the dimensions of the case?
  :answer: The A22 Carry is 22" x 14" x 9". These are the maximum allowable dimensions
    for carry-on luggage. The A28 Check is 28" x 21" x 13". The A22 Carry has an interior
    capacity of 35 Liters. The A28 Check has an interior capacity of 106.7 Liters.
- :question: How much does the case weigh?
  :answer: The A22 Carry weighs 8.4 lbs. The A28 Check weighs 13 lbs.  It’s among
    the lightest in the luggage industry for German polycarbonate hard-shell cases.
- :question: What materials are used in the case?
  :answer: |-
    Raden’s exterior shells are made with a Makrolon® ET German Polycarbonate.
      The wheels are a mix of nylon and PU/PP plastics. The side handle is a Polyurethane,
      while the top handle is a blend of PC+ABS, ABS and zinc alloy. Our interior
      linings are polyester.
- :question: Can I use my case as a carry-on?
  :answer: |-
    Of course. The A22 Carry is 22" x 14" x 9", which is the maximum size
      and allowable volume for most U.S. airlines.
- :question: What is a TSA lock and how do I use it?
  :answer: |-
    In the U.S., the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires access to luggage without the passenger being present. Raden's integrated TSA lock uses zipper pulls without any additional accessories, making it easy for authorized TSA personnel to access to your case for inspection (if necessary).
    To unzip your newly delivered Raden case, first open your TSA lock by following these steps: Set the number wheel to read “0-0-0.” With the front of the case facing you and the two zippers locked into the faceplate, slide the unlocking mechanism to the right (hint: the unlocking mechanism looks like a slim, vertical rectangle and is right next to the TSA keyhole).
- :question: How do I clean my case?
  :answer: |-
    To remove dirt and small scuffs, Raden recommends to use a non-abrasive agent such as Isopropanol alcohol, which is commonly available at drug stores. Apply a few milliliters of Isopropanol to a cloth or directly onto the dirt or residue marks left on your shell, and wipe away until clean. Repeat as needed.
    DO NOT USE:

      Scouring detergents or abrasive cloths/sponges (i.e. steel wool)
      Window cleaning agents, vinegar-based cleaners, or disinfectants including Goo Gone.
      Solvents, dilutions, or aggressive alcohols
      Petroleum distillates (white spirit/petrol based agents) including nail polisher remover

    Note that above agents will damage your Raden.
- :question: How do I set or reset my own TSA lock combination?
  :answer: |-
    For initial setting, ensure the combination is set to "0-0-0". Then,
      using a pen tip, push the lock faceplate’s silver reset button so that it
      stays down. Slide each number wheel to the 3-digit combination of your choice.
      Slide the unlocking mechanism so that the reset button pops back to its
      starting place. Your lock is now reset to your chosen 3-digit combination.
- :question: Is the case scratch-resistant?
  :answer: |-
    Raden applies a post-production resin to its polycarbonate
    shells, which helps prevent scuffing and scratching during
    transit. That being said, marks will make their way onto the
    case, regardless of the specific finish. Wear and tear is a
    natural sign of more travel memories and frequent flier miles.
- :question: My case is damaged. What should I do?
  :answer: |-
    Raden is committed to providing the highest level of service for its
      customers. Your case is protected under our warranty policy, which you can review
      here

      handles, wheels, zipper pulls, electronic modules and USB cables. If you
      need assistance with a repair or replacement part, contact our customer
      experience team
      here.
- :question: Is the case waterproof?
  :answer: |-
    Absolutely. Raden’s shells are waterproof, as are the reverse-coated
      Polyurethane zippers which provide a waterproof layer to the zippered seams.
- :question: Has the case undergone any regulatory certifications?
  :answer: |-
